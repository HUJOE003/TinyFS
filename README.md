## Todo

### Demo Program + Video
Could you include testing the fragmentation feature in the demo program? There is code to test it in fragTest so just copy some of the stuff over but make it smaller.

Make a video which demonstrates the basic functionality of the required functions and the chosen additional functionality. 

### Getting Submission Ready
I am not entirely sure if the TinyFS_errno.h file should be capitalized, in the test files it is but in the spec it isn't.

Format the README and fill out survey.
